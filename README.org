* How to Use This Configuration

This repo is meant to be a companion to the Emacs From Scratch video series, serving as an example of a custom configuration build on top of vanilla Emacs.  I give instructions below for how to set it up to try it out, but it isn't meant to be used as your main configuration!  My goal here is to provide a working configuration that you can take inspiration from (and copy from directly).

Just keep in mind that this repo isn't set up to be used directly as your own configuration!  Copy the code to your own dotfiles repository and have fun :)
